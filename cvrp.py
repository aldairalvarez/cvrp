'''
the depot will always be at index 0 and have a demand of 0
we code the variable x into a matrix n*n that is symmetric and has a null diagonal. We choose to consider as valid, indices (i,j) such that i>j (all others will not be computed)
a solution is a varialbe x whose values ( for i>j ) are all integer a which verifies all capacity constraints and degree constraints
a feasible solution is a solution that satisfies all constraints (cap and degree) but whose values are not all integer
